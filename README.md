# GoSec

## Description

_First and foremost, this is just an opportunity for me to learn [Go](http://golang.org/)._

Ultimately, the goal here is to create a security assessment tool that connects to nodes and
assesses their state based on [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](http://www.cisecurity.org/)
standards.
